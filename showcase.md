## Showcase and screenshots

### Disclaimer
When I first recorded the below, a lot of them were only intended for friends
and family. I've since realised these make for a pretty good showcase, although
some were unfortunately recorded by pointing a phone a computer screen.

Due to the project still being in early stages of development, much of these
visuals require writing special code to make visible. Writing code just to
reproduce a showcase takes time, yet these features will eventually reveal
themselves naturally as the code evolves. For that reason I feel the poor
quality showcase is acceptable for now. This will be revised in future to have
a more professional feel.

## Early stages

### Demo
Very first gif recorded to show literally anything. In this image, the Sun,
Moon, and Earth are to scale and have real-world distance. Their rotations are
wrong, though.
